    abstract = "{The study sought to understand the impact of a phishing training program on phishing click rates for employees at a single, anonymous US healthcare institution. We stratified our population into 2 groups: offenders and nonoffenders. Offenders were defined as those that had clicked on at least 5 simulated phishing emails and nonoffenders were those that had not. We calculated click rates for offenders and nonoffenders, before and after a mandatory training program for offenders was implemented. A total of 5416 unique employees received all 20 campaigns during the intervention period; 772 clicked on at least 5 emails and were labeled offenders. Only 975 (17.9\%) of our set clicked on 0 phishing emails over the course of the 20 campaigns; 3565 (65.3\%) clicked on at least 2 emails. There was a decrease in click rates for each group over the 20 campaigns. The mandatory training program, initiated after campaign 15, did not have a substantial impact on click rates, and the offenders remained more likely to click on a phishing simulation. Phishing is a common threat vector against hospital employees and an important cybersecurity risk to healthcare systems. Our work suggests that, under simulation, employee click rates decrease with repeated simulation, but a mandatory training program targeted at high-risk employees did not meaningfully decrease the click rates of this population. Employee phishing click rates decrease over time, but a mandatory training program for the highest-risk employees did not decrease click rates when compared with lower-risk employees.}",
